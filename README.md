###  ***ALL code is written by me, models are custom-built in Blender and extra touch-ups are done in the Unity Particle System! No external media was used!***

## Description

#### This is a basic framework for a FPS (first-person-shooter) game.

-	This prototype provides:	

    -	An advanced movement framework for a first-person game;

    -	Enemy movement patterns and attack mechanics;

    -	An easily modifiable physics system;

-	Although unfinished, the core game mechanics are well defined and the prototype is a fun experience on its own,
-	The demo was made in Unity, with code written in C#.
-	Assets made in Blender/Aseprite + Unity Particle system.
